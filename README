# Effective Data Lineage Strategies for Real-Time Systems Demo Project

This project was built as a demo to demonstrate real-time Lineage. It's a toy application using OpenLineage and Marquez. 

## Project Structure

This is the structure of this project:

![Demo diagram](demo.png)

There are 3 sub-projects:
- predict-prep
- predict-enrich
- predict-handler

These are relatively simple Java/Spring Boot/Kafka projects instrumented with OpenLineage.

They will send lineage information to Marquez.

Application data is fed into predict-prep, transformed by predict-enrich, and then stored in Postgres by predict-handler. They communicate to eachother via Kafka.

## Prerequisites

Only Docker is needed to run the demo. The docker-compose file will build and containerize the Java projects. All other dependencies are pulled.

If you want to interact with the demo while running you will need:
- psql
- kafka cli
- web browser

If you want to modify/build the projects locally you will need:
- Java 21

## The code

The code is really simple and verbose. It demonsrates the concepts for academic purposes.
